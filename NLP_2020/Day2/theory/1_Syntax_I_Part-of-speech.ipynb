    "# What are parts of speech?\n",
    "\n",
    "A __syntactic theory__ for a language is a theoretical characterization of the language's well formed sentences. Although there is a plethora of syntactic theories, basically all of them rely on some notion of \"parts of speech\" (POS for short), i.e., basic syntactic roles that expressions can have in well formed sentences. For instance, in the standard constituency analysis of the English sentence\n",

    "\"John\" and \"ball\" are nouns, \"hit\" is a verb, and \"the\" is a determinant -- these are all parts of speech categorizations that are an important part of the full syntactic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Context dependence__\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the part of speech role played by an expression can be context dependent. For instance, in contrast to the previous sentence, \"hit\" in the sentence\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "is a noun. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Theory and language dependence__\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the full list of POS categories is language and syntactic theory dependent, some parts of speech are pretty much universal, e.g. the categories __noun__, __verb__, __adjective__ and __adverb__ can be found in almost all languages and syntactic theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Open vs closed POS categories__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closed POS categories, e.g., the category of determiners in English, consist of relatively small sets of words, and these sets do not change easily: it's a rare phenomenon that a new determiner is added to a language.\n",
    "- Open POS categories, on the other hand, like that of English verbs, contain a large number of words and new members are added on daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strongly related distinction is that of between __function words__ and __content words__: while words belonging to open POS categories are content words in the sense that they typically have a more or less well characterizable lexical semantic content on their own (many verbs refer to actions, many proper nouns to indviduals etc.), closed POS categories contain words without much independent semantic content -- their semantics is closely tied to their semantic function within sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why are POS categories useful?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the POS category of each word in a text is the first linguistic analysis step after tokenization/sentence segmentation: it is necessary for all later stages, i.e. full syntactic analysis, semantics etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being an important part of syntax, part of speech information contains useful information about a word's\n",
    "- __distributional properties__, i.e., in which context the word can occur, e.g., in English nouns can be preceded by a determiner, but not verbs, and, especially for content words, about its \n",
    "- __semantics__, e.g., verbs frequently (but not exclusively) refer to some sort of actions/events while nouns frequently refer to participants of these actions/events.\n",
