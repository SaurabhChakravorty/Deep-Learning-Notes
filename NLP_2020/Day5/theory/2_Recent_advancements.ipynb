    "Although the first generation of successful word embedding methods like Word2vec and GloVe produced vector representations for text tokens that proved to be hugely beneficial for most NLP tasks, they have some important limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Context independence:__ A word has only one representation: The word \"bank\" will have the same embedding in the sentences \"I went to my bank to withdraw some money.\" and  \"We explored the river bank.\", even though the two meanings are clearly different.\n",
    "+ __Words are black boxes:__ In reality, words have internal structure: They consist of characters, and from the linguistic point of view, they can be composed of several morphemes (stem, inflections, etc.). Nevertheless, the representation learning methods of Word2vec, GloVe etc. ignore this internal structure and treat words as black boxes. The only information they use to produce the representations is word-level distribution, regardless of internal connections, like having the same stem etc.\n",
    "+ __No useful representation for unseen or rare words:__ Because words are treated as black boxes, these models cannot produce useful representations for words that do not occur or are very rare in the training corpus, as there is no (or not enough) contextual information about them.\n",
    "+ __Good vocabulary coverage requires huge model dimensions:__ Again because of the black box word handling, a word can get a meaningful representation only if it's explicitly included in the vocabulary of the model. But the memory consumption is typically a linear function of the covered vocabulary (one of the dimensions of the embedding matrices is the vocabulary size).\n",
    "+ __Language dependence:__ Since embeddings are intended to express the *semantics* of words, one would expect that the embeddings associated with words that express the same meaning in different languages should be identical or at least highly similar. Unfortunately, for embeddings trained -- as usual -- on monolingual corpora this not the case."

    "\n",
    "Although we have seen that the usage of attention mechanisms enables the processing over elaborate external memory structures, later on with the advancement of research it turned out that attention mechanisms even without any external memory are extremely powerful in sequence modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The __transformer__ is a powerful seq2seq encoder-decoder architecture which is built solely from \"transformer modules\" consisting of attention and feed-forward layers without using RNN-s. Nonetheless, in most NLP tasks (e.g., language modeling, translation, question answering etc.) transformer-based models have recently significantly outperformed the \"more traditional\" RNN-based encoder-decoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention in general\n",

    "The basic attention schema used in transformers can be described as follows: We want to \"attend\" to part(s) of a certain $\\mathbf X=\\langle \\mathbf x_1,\\dots,\\mathbf x_n \\rangle$ sequence of vectors (embeddings).
