    "1. Detect the overall intent of the given utterance\n",

    "Though the standard practice for the first step is to build up a sentence classifier, and the second is done usually with some token level classifier / matching, now we will utilize the same rule based matching mechanism of SpaCy that we did before, albeit with a twist.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems, as we saw before is the **variety of utterances**, that is, people tend to formulate the same intent in myriad ways. We will intend to mitigate this by **increasing coverage with WorNet synonyms**.\n",
