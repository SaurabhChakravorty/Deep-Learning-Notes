    "\n",
    "It has a complete, streaming capable analysis pipeline, hence allows for the processing of text corpora of considerable size. It's main design principle is to utilize as many resources of a single server for computation as possible, and whenever it is feasible, allow for \"out-of-core\" approaches.\n",

    "  CPU-friendly) approach to approximating TfIdf distances between documents, by throwing in a little randomness.\n",
    "  Recommended target dimensionality is again in the hundreds/thousands, depending on your dataset.\n",

    "  dimensionality. LDA is a probabilistic extension of LSA (also called multinomial PCA),\n",
    "  so LDA's topics can be interpreted as probability distributions over words. These distributions are,\n",
    "  just like with LSA, inferred automatically from a training corpus. Documents\n",
    "  are in turn interpreted as a (soft) mixture of these topics (again, just like with LSA).\n",

    "  `gensim` uses a fast, online implementation based on [3]_.\n",
    "  The HDP model is a new addition to `gensim`, and still rough around its academic edges -- use with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new `VSM (Vector Space Model)` transformations (such as different weighting schemes) is rather trivial;\n",
    "see the `apiref` or directly the [Python code](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/tfidfmodel.py)\n",
    "for more info and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth repeating that these are all unique, **incremental** implementations,\n",
    "which do not require the whole training corpus to be present in main memory all at once.\n",
    "With memory taken care of, I am now improving `distributed`,\n",
    "to improve CPU efficiency, too.\n",
    "If you feel you could contribute by testing, providing use-cases or code, see the [Gensim Developer guide](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Developer-page).\n",
