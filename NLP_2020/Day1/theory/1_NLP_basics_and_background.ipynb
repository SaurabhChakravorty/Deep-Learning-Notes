    "\n",
    "Let us presuppose the situation that an \"agent\" (epistemic system) is located in an environment with its own dynamics together with other agents and tries to reach its goals via perceiving its environment (and the other agents actions in it) and taking actions (subset of which is communicative action towards other agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "See the definition of Wikipedia on [\"intelligent agent\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent), originally from Russell & Norvig (2003, chpt. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "We trace the notion of intelligence back to the this efficent goal seeking behavior, which in turn presupposes getting to know (learn) and apply invariances (knowledge) which has predictive power about the environment (and the agent itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note, that for efficient coordination of actions quality **communication** is necessary among the agents, which in turn presupposes the presence of some **common representations among the agents** about the world and themselves.\n",

    "The different emphasis on knowledge and learning represent the two major \"schools\", and two epochs of (cognitive science and) AI research:\n",
    "- The \"symbolic\" or \"knowledge based\" \"style\", which (amongst other things) had it's roots in classical logical reasoning as well as ontological knowledge representation, and was influential in the creation of the World Wide Web. (\"knowledge bases\", \"expert systems\", \"ontologies\", \"reasoning engines\" are all the product of this approach)\n",
    "- The \"learning\" based style, which can be considered as being in strong connection with statistics and can be termed \"machine learning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This **dual approach** of symbol and rule based and distributed / probabilistic concepts and techniques will be a **core motif in Natural Language Processing**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection between communication and representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we concern ourselves with the **communication** between agents, we will naturally emphasize the **knowledge representation** aspect, since we suppose, that this representation is in strong connection with the **encoding, transferring and decoding** of **meanings** and **intents** between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Note: the Symbolic aspect implies two things:\n",

    "There is a widespread tradition in philosophy, psychology and cognitive science that appreciates the deep connection, sometimes even equality of a language and thought. (For the connections between self-talk and self-knowledge see eg.: [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10947675_Relations_among_self-talk_self-consciousness_and_self-knowledge))\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed account of this position in cognitive science see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This position lends itself easily to integration with the **\"classical computational paradigm\"** of symbol manipulation, thus was pretty widespread with the advent of computation machinery. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, argument arose against the symbolic paradigm on multiple fronts, since neural and experimental evidence can not account for any kind of localized symbolic computation in the brain, thus a more broad view of **\"distributed representation\"** and **\"emergent cognition\"** has been proposed. \n",

    "**Meaning (semantics) is strongly defined by the domain!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certain meanings are **undefined** outside of the domain (eg.: anatomic jargon)\n",
    "- Certain meanings are **overridden** in a domain (eg.: see below)\n",

    "\n",
    "##  Typical tasks in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "### End user goals\n",
    "\n",
    "From the user perspective the typical goals (s)he would like to achieve by using an NLP enabled system are the same as the general case for agents:\n",
    "- **Information retrieval / Question answering:** User would like to gain knowledge (\"What are the ingredients of chicken curry?\")\n",
    "- **Information organization:** User would like to organize, structure, categorize knowledge\n",
    "- **Information transformation:** User would like to make the system transform knowledge from one form to the other (**machine translation**, **document summarization**) \n",
    "- **Action automation:** User would like to carry out an action or wants the system to carry it out (\"Order the ingredients on amazon, please!\", \"Automatically assign incoming mails to agents\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Though these sound obvious, by designing NLP systems, it is easy to forget about the design principle of user first. It is always important to ask the question: \"What does the user want to achieve **in her situation** (context) with the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate actions\n",
    "\n",
    "For reaching the above mentioned goal, typically multiple steps of processing are necessary, which are themselves complex NLP activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples (incomplete):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://content-static.upwork.com/blog/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/27091951/image-101.png\" width=50%>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "([source](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/for-clients/artificial-intelligence-and-natural-language-processing-in-big-data/))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision of a pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this understanding of compositionality, as well as the hierarchy of tasks that can be carried out, the **most prevalent vision of NLP systems is that of a pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/16b2ccafeefd6d547171afa23f9ac62f159e353d/48b91/pipeline-7a14d4edd18f3edfee8f34393bff2992.svg\" width=65%>\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the pipeline carries out subsequent tasks **dependent on each-other**, whereby one usually travels along **\"upwards\" in the hierarchy of linguistics** (from morphemes to syntax to semantics,...) as well as **larger and larger chunks of text** (from words to sentences to documents,...) \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is a handy metaphor, reality is - as it is usually - more complicated, not infrequently, **the solutions for the sub-tasks are circular.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take for example the case of **contractions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Nms48ml_40I6bOb91Vzj7aAriqMzTc9e\" width=35%>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case for the resolution of the contraction, one would have to decide if we are talking about _\"would have\"_ or _\"had have\"_. This, though only represents a tokenization / lemmatization task, can only be decided by knowledge about the sentence syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we would think, that this is a fringe problem, well, let's think twice. In Portugese eg. such contractions can represent ~2% of all words. see: [Tokenization-Tagging circularity](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee95/19a48834acc972d453de0fc1c5932e8055a0.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "So pipeline is a widespread, useful but incomplete notion...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmarks and progress\n",
    "\n",
    "As for all areas of machine learning, there are dedicated tasks and benchmarks that measure the progress in the state of the art. These naturally **do not reflect** the totality of real life project complexity and challenges, but can be good estimates of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiyong_Lu2/publication/275772841/figure/fig3/AS:294551743942659@1447238016369/Challenges-subtasks-tracks-organized-based-on-NLP-perspectives.png\" width=60%>\n",

    "\n",
    "For an estimate of progress see: [Electronic Frontier Foundation - AI Progress metrics](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "To further the general progress in the field, notable \"hub organizations\", like the [Association for Computational Linguistics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/what-is-cl) organize \"challenges\" or \"shared tasks\", like [SemEval](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/semeval-2019-international-workshop-semantic-evaluation) that act as a measuring rod for the state of the art. These challenges became major drivers of progress in the field."
