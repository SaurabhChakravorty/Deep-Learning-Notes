    "[Texar](https://github.com/asyml/texar) is a toolkit from Carnegie Mellon University for building and training text generating machine learning models, especially neural models. Originally it was built on top of TensorFlow, but now a [PyTorch version](https://github.com/asyml/texar-pytorch) is also in active development, which aims at providing an identical API.\n",
