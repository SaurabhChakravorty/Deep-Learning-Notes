    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, let's do a short recap on the evolution of unsupervised representation learning with deep neural models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple AE\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic approach for representation learning with deep networks is to use an encoder-decoder framework, wherby the encoder turns the input into a dense vector representation (code), and the decoder in turn tries to reconstruct the original data as well as possible. The reconstruction error is often times taken to be a simple squared error metric (eg. pixelwise error, in case of images).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3148/1*44eDEuZBEsmG_TCAKRI3Kw@2x.png\" width=55%>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable structural porperty of this setup is the relative **low dimensional bottleneck** formed by the code itself. This fact, that only a severely limited \"storage space\" is available for the representation of the data, this presents an **[information bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bottleneck_method)**, thus enforces compression, hence, the extraction of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, this encoder-decoder structure, as well as the employed loss / learning method does not pose any kind of structural constraints, so any kind of \"transposable\" operation can be a part of the network. If one figures out, what is the transpose of the convolution and pooling operator, one can easily imagine a convolutiuonal network as being the encoder and decoder as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detour: The transpose of convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The task in the decoder is to somehow **upsample** the code into an actually usable image. In a convolutional architecture, this is not absolutely trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter \"deconvolution\" layers!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic/raw/master/gif/padding_strides_transposed.gif\" width=35%>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well worth noting, that in the mathematical sense, this **can not be considered [deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution) proper**, so the so called deconvolution layers are somewhat of a misnomer. So what happens here instead is, that these **fractionally strided convolutions** (or even sometimes called transposed convolutions) are learning upsampling patterns (\"filters\") for the increase of the image dimensions (and the decrease of channel numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xifeng_Guo/publication/320658590/figure/fig1/AS:614154637418504@1523437284408/The-structure-of-proposed-Convolutional-AutoEncoders-CAE-for-MNIST-In-the-middle-there.png\" width=55%>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The problem with pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems with the pooling operator in classical convnets is the fact, that it is not invertible. (Since there is information loss during the pooling itself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to put it another way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Unpooling: In the convnet, the max pooling operation is non-invertible, however we can obtain an approximate inverse by recording the locations of the maxima within each pooling region in a set of switch variables. In the deconvnet, the unpooling operation uses these switches to place the reconstructions from the layer above into appropriate locations, preserving the structure of the stimulus.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901v3.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of pooling and unpooling into convolutional autoencoder models would thus complicate the model considerably. Instead of this, the usage of **strided convolution** as an alternative is often used. (Some people suggest, that even for other use cases, the usage of strides instead of explicit pooling is [not a bad idea](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/387482/pooling-vs-stride-for-downsampling).\n",

    "One of the main limitaitons of the simple autoencoder can well be observed on the picture above.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are densely packed regions of space with the appropriate digits placed near to each-other. So far good. But on the other hand, the variability of the data is not so good, so if we would try to generate new datapoints, for many regions, we would be out of luck. (see the gaps between the classes...)\n",

    "Or to put it another way: **the model is in a sense \"overfit\" to the observed data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can help preventing overfitting? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, for example noise!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making it more robust: Denoising AE\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying motivation behind denoising autoencoders is to use input noise (\"corruption\") to enforce the stability and generalization of the learned inner representations of the network, much along the lines how noise acts positively in general deep learning training, in the form of data augmentation, dropout, minibatch gradient noise, etc.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Making it interpretable (?): Sparse autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "In everyday settings, we are having strong assumption, that some finite amount of real causes are underlying the great variety of experiences we are faced with. In a visual setting eg. it is rational to assume, that the number of objects in the room is way lower, than the resulting pixels from different view angles, lighting conditions, etc. Thus, it is a very natural urge, to **disentangle input**, that is **to find a _sparse_ low dimensional representation of it's underlying causes** (hopefully).\n",

    "\n",
    "A generally useful tool called **reparametrization trick** can be applied here. The main idea is, that a random variable can be decomposed to be a random sample form a distribution with mean zero and unit variance, and parameters, that is a variance with which we multiply, and a mean, that we add. \n",

    "\n",
    "### The loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "From practical standpoint, and for the sake of simplicity, we posited the original distribution that we reparametrize with the mean(s) and varaince(s) (in a multivariate case) to be a gaussian. For all intents and purposes we would thus like to ensure, that the learned distribution is not far away from the one we posited.\n",

    "A very nice in-depth discussion of the VAE loss can be found [here](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/12/10/variational-autoencoder/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connections with variational inference\n",
    "\n",
    "It is to be noted, that the idea of positing some kind of \"family\" of distributions, then to find the specific perameters of this distribution via optimization methods is a much more general concept, and is called [variational inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods). Thus, the VAE model can be considered to be an example of the general class of variational inference methods.  \n",

    "### Controlling the latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in the \"true\" generative factors behind the data, and would like to excert control over the latent representation, one form we can choose is - paradoxically - to **train a VAE on a supervised dataset**, where **we use the class labels as additional conditions** which constrain the generation process, thus, ensure some kind of control over the latent representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is called **conditional variational autoencoder**, and the gist of the idea is to add the original class labels as input vectors for the generator and the discriminator as well:\n",

    "\"\n",
    "- Our visualization illustrates the large difference between AEs and VAEs regarding their behavior in latent space. For the given input images, the value range in latent space is $[â5.93,5.98]$ for the VAE in contrast to $[â22.59,74.46]$ for the AE.\n",
    "- This makes clear why generating new content with AEs is difficult. To come up with new latent vectors, we need a lot of luck to find a value for which the decoder knows a useful reconstruction. In case of our VAE, we simply need to draw random samples from a standard normal distribution with a good chance that the decoder produces valid output.\n",
    "- With respect to the full range in which latent values occur, the VAE produces reasonable outputs over a larger range than the AE.\n",
    "- To our own surprise, interpolations between multiple images work quite well with both VAE and AE. It is interesting where the compression locates values in latent space. By just modifying the value of a single dimension, it is possible to generate multiple images of different digits.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of VAE-s\n",
    "\n",
    "The strong constraints we put on the VAE model come at a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is far more difficult to represent a complex distribution, if you are penalized strognly with a KL term, since two regions with high probability, that no longer fit a single gaussian well will get \"averaged out\", so the multiple **\"modes\"** of a multimodal distribution **\"collapse\"** into one rather \"average\" distribution.\n",
