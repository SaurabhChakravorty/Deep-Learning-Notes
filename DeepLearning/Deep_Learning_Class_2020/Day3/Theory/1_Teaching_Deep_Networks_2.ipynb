    "### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to **randomly choose** some neurons (typically with 0.5 probability \"coin flip\") that we \"switch off\", we regard them as temporarily not being part of the network. We set their activation to 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**When we finish the training, we use THE WHOLE NETWORK as one**, but we have to norm the outputs with a normalization term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Original paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHYYYY?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all: we don't know exactly. There are some ideas, and an emerging consensus.\n",
    "2. It is plausible that the \"interdependency\" (\"coupling\", \"entanglement of hidden factors\") is also increasing during training (quasi complexity, more like dependency), which causes more \"brittle\" or arbitrary decision boundaries (not a large margin one). This is a nice metaphor, but the literature is not backing it fully up .\n",
    "3. It is in practice a form of model averaging, that is, a self contained \"ensemble model\" - see below.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dropout makes training more difficult, **decreases training performance**\n",
    "2. As a rule of thumb, using dropout **_approximately_ doubles required training time**, but epoch time usually decreases (remember, you are zeroing out half of the gradients...)\n",
    "3. In case of $h$ hidden neurons when we apply dropout with probability $p$, we train approximately $2^h$ models, and we do the prediction with their \"ensemble\", decreasing activations by a factor of $p$\n",
    "4. Dropout forces the network to learn *robust* features, which are useful for many other random neuron groups in their decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection with ensemble methods\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the most widespread opinion, during dropout, we create a weakly coupled group or *ensemble* of learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dropout training is similar to bagging (Breiman, 1994), where many different models are trained on different subsets of the data. Dropout training differs from bagging in that each model is trained for only one step and all of the models share parameters. For this training procedure (dropout) to behave as if it is training an ensemble rather than a single model, each update must have a large effect, so that it makes the sub-model induced by that µ fit the current input v well.\"\n",

    "#### Sidenote: Dropout may be more important than we think\n",
    "\n",

The fast weights are updated through applying $A$, any standard optimization algorithm, to batches of training examples sampled from the dataset $D$. After $k$ inner optimizer updates using $A$, the slow weights are updated towards the fast weights by linearly interpolating in weight space, $θ − φ$. We denote the slow weights learning rate as $α$. After each slow weights update, the fast weights are reset to the current slow weights value.\"\n",

The result is reduced variance during training, and much less sensitivity to sub-optimal hyper-parameters and reduces the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning... By way of simple analogy, LookAhead can be thought of as the following. Imagine you are at the top of a mountain range, with various dropoff’s all around. One of them leads to the bottom and success, but others are simply crevasses with no good ending. To explore by yourself would be hard because you’d have to drop down each one, and assuming it was a dead end, find your way back out. But, if you had a buddy who would stay at or near the top and help pull you back up if things didn’t look good, you’d probably make a lot more progress towards finding the best way down because exploring the full terrain would proceed much more quickly and with far less likelihood of being stuck in a bad crevasse.\"\n",

    "## Do we need training and big networks at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "To say that the field of deep learning is in flux is a mayor understatement. We at least assumed, that the fact, that we need large networks and train them for an extensive period of time with sophisticated methods holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, maybe not so, in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...after training a network, **set all weights smaller than some threshold to zero (prune them), rewind the rest of the weights to their initial configuration, and then retrain the network from this starting configuration keeping the pruned weights weights frozen (not trained).** Using this approach, they obtained two intriguing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they showed that the pruned networks performed well. **Aggressively pruned networks (with 99.5 percent to 95 percent of weights pruned) showed no drop in performance compared to the much larger, unpruned network. Moreover, networks only moderately pruned (with 50 percent to 90 percent of weights pruned) often outperformed their unpruned counterparts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, as compelling as these results were, the characteristics of the remaining network structure and weights were just as interesting. Normally, if you take a trained network, re-initialize it with random weights, and then re-train it, its performance will be about the same as before. But with the skeletal Lottery Ticket (LT) networks, this property does not hold. The network trains well only if it is rewound to its initial state, including the specific initial weights that were used. Reinitializing it with new weights causes it to train poorly. As pointed out in Frankle and Carbin’s study, it would appear that the **specific combination of pruning mask** (a per-weight binary value indicating whether or not to delete the weight) **and weights underlying the mask form a lucky sub-network** found within the larger network, or, as named by the original study, a winning “Lottery Ticket.”\"\n",
